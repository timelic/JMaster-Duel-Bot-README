## Features
The tool's features currently are:
- [Botting solo duels for XP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJbZtvzDB1Q) (and therefore unlimited lifetime mission gem rewards)  
*Note: It's now recommended to use the "Solo XP Network Bot" instead.*
- [Solo XP Network Bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbN9Vcv_FmM) (Level your account up to level 50 easily and earn gems)
- Complete All Solo Chapters Network Bot (Automatically completes the entire solo mode within 5 minutes and gives you ~18.000 gems on a new account)  
*Note: This feature is currently not publicly available but this might change in the future. This feature is very useful for account selling.*
- [Botting PvP Duels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMmEmrLBQoA) (Currently only with passing turns but will be extended to support dueling with certain decks like [D.D. Dynamite deck botting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JT3NS8Iar8))
- Starting, quitting, pausing and resuming the game
- [Instant Win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_rI8beVxaM) (Working for solo mode only, as the name implies, basically sets the opponent's LP to 0 so you win the duel immediately)
- [Set your LP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0iOH-x-170) (Compatible with solo only once again, may still be buggy)
- [Force Replay Controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0iOH-x-170) (During duels you can enable replay controls as if you were watching an actual duel replay)
- [Reveal All Cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK-TBbZb8gc) (PvE only, in PvP face-down cards are shown in pink, hence the data isn't available anymore)
- [Speed Hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88L3He5ybjM) (Faster overall gameplay/animations)
- [Card Rarity Mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d24A0XXhGMk) (All cards a certain rarity but it's a visual only mod during duels and does not affect your owned cards)
- [Duel Skipper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34L1Rf_eAB0) (Faster "Instant Win" when used with "Duel Result" set to "Win")
- [Disconnect Duel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynMg10qTHbo) (Avoid losses in PvP at any time during the duel by invalidating the duel)
- [~~PvP~~ Solo Surrender Mod [Credits to traumschmuser]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztSCcWuZ3ds) (Force your opponent to surrender so you win instantly)
- Disable PvP Inactivity Surrender (No longer lose automatically for being idle)
- Disable Unity Crash Reporter (No crash reports sent to Konami): This happens automatically when running the application
- [Play illegal Decks in ~~PvP~~ Solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdcfKqkr1jk) (Forbidden cards and non-owned cards, essentially unlock all cards at 3x and allow playing less than 40 cards in your main deck)
- Duel Spoofer (Allows you to build and play any decks you want in solo via the bot's UI completely with no deck building limitations at all and load/save deck profiles in JSON format, MasterDuelMeta.com saved decks can be loaded as well)
- [Duel Spy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqKje6WB5A4) (Allows seeing your entire deck ordering in ~~PvP~~ solo duels)
- *... potentially more*
